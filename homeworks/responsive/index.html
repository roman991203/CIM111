      <h1>Topic</h1>
      <p>Taking photos is a long path. And it is also a recording of ourlives. Photographers use light and shadow to reflect and compose photos with their own styles. As a new student who is learning Photography, I took ART210 in the first semester. From learning a lot of other Photographers' way of taking photos, I improved a lot in my photos. And for this website, I put some of my photos during ART210 class.</p>

        <img src="img/Q.jpg" alt="Alphabet Letters">
        <p>The first photo is about the "Alphabet Letters" project. For this project, our professor asked us to take photos about letters from A to Z. It is easy to find letters in our life. However, when you wanted to take photos during your life, it was a hard and long way to do that. It cost me about a whole day to find all letters in UM campus. But when I went back and saw what I got, everything was worthy.</p>

        <p>The second photo is about traveling. Our professor asked us to take some photos about our fall recess traveling. So for that fall recess, I went to Cuba with my friends. Cuba is a really nice place for taking photos, with multiple colors and its unique style. The culture and tradition there was amazing and attractive. For this photo, I found a place that can overlook the whole street. And I also found a man who was holding his child. That attracted me a lot so that I caught that funny moment on the street.</p>

        <img src="img/R.jpg" alt="Reflection">
        <p>The third photo is about the refection. For this project, our professor asked us to imitate a photographer that we like. So I just imitated a photographer who takes the reflection photos. The meaning of reflection photos is that photographer taking photos from the mirror and glasses on the street. That is a fresh concept for a beginner. But in the end, I think I did a good job for my project.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>As I said before, imitating is the first step for beginners. We can learn how to composing, styles, and skills from them and then create our own photos. It is a process and we can feel our improvement slowly and gradually. I am so fortunate to choose this class and choose photography as my interest. Whenever the time goes, photos can always bring us back to the time that we taking them. That is an amazing time traveling.</p>
